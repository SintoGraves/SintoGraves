Authorâ€™s Statement â€“ Sinto Graâ€™ves

Reason Over Rhetoric is a forum for disciplined thinking in a noisy democracy. Each op-ed challenges readersâ€”and those in powerâ€”to weigh words against duty, and ambition against the oath they swore. Rather than echo partisan talking points, these essays trace the Constitutionâ€™s intent and the responsibilities it places on those who serve under it.

This project exists to rekindle civic reasoning: to remind citizens that loyalty to the Republic begins with loyalty to truth. Whether addressing Congressâ€™s inertia, executive overreach, or the erosion of public trust, every piece follows a single ruleâ€”think first, speak second. By reviving reflection, Reason Over Rhetoric seeks to make debate once again a public service, not a performance.
